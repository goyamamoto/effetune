## Technical Information

### Browser Compatibility

Frieve EffeTune has been tested and verified to work on Google Chrome. The application requires a modern browser with support for:
- Web Audio API
- Audio Worklet
- getUserMedia API
- Drag and Drop API

### Browser Support Details
1. Chrome/Chromium
   - Fully supported and recommended
   - Update to latest version for best performance

2. Firefox/Safari
   - Limited support
   - Some features may not work as expected
   - Consider using Chrome for best experience

### Recommended Sample Rate

For optimal performance with nonlinear effects, it is recommended to use EffeTune at a sample rate of 96kHz or higher. This higher sample rate helps achieve ideal characteristics when processing audio through nonlinear effects such as saturation and compression.

## Development Guide
