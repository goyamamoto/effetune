## 1. Initial Setup for Streaming

Windows example: Spotify → VB-CABLE → EffeTune → DAC/AMP. Concepts are similar for other services and OSes.

### 1.1. Installing VB-CABLE and enabling 96 kHz
Download the VB-CABLE Driver Pack45, run `VBCABLE_Setup_x64.exe` as administrator, and reboot. Return the OS default output to your speakers/DAC and set both **CABLE Input** and **CABLE Output** formats to 24‑bit, 96,000 Hz. Launch `VBCABLE_ControlPanel.exe` as administrator, choose **Menu▸Internal Sample Rate = 96000 Hz**, then click **Restart Audio Engine**.

### 1.2. Streaming service routing (Spotify example)
Open **Settings▸System▸Sound▸Volume mixer**, and set `Spotify.exe` output to **CABLE Input**. Play a track to confirm silence from the speakers.
On macOS, use Rogue Amoeba's **SoundSource** to assign Spotify output to **CABLE Input** in the same manner.

### 1.3. EffeTune audio settings
Launch the desktop app and open **Config Audio**.
- **Input Device:** CABLE Output (VB-Audio Virtual Cable)
- **Output Device:** Physical DAC/Speakers
- **Sample Rate:** 96,000 Hz (lower rates may degrade quality)

### 1.4. Operation check
With Spotify playing, toggle the master **ON/OFF** in EffeTune and confirm the sound changes.

## 2. Troubleshooting

### 2.1. Audio playback quality issues

| Symptom | Solution |
| ------ | ------ |
| Dropouts or glitches | Click the **Reset Audio** button in the top-left corner of the web app or choose **Reload** from the **View** menu in the desktop app. Reduce the number of active effects if necessary. |
| Distortion or clipping | Insert **Level Meter** at the end of the chain and keep levels below 0 dBFS. Add **Brickwall Limiter** before Level Meter if needed. |
| Aliasing above 20 kHz | VB-CABLE may still run at 48 kHz. Recheck the initial setup. |

### 2.2. High CPU usage
Disable effects you're not using or remove them from the **Effect Pipeline**.

### 2.3. Echo
Your input and output devices may be looping back. Ensure EffeTune's output does not return to its input.

### 2.4. Input, output, or effect problems

| Symptom | Solution |
| ------ | ------ |
| No audio input | Make sure the player outputs to **CABLE Input**. Allow microphone permission in the browser and select **CABLE Output** as the input device. |
| Effect not working | Confirm the master, each effect, and any **Section** are **ON**. Reset parameters if needed. |
| No audio output | For the web app, check that the OS and browser outputs point to your DAC/AMP. For the desktop app, check the output device in **Config Audio**. |
| Other players report "CABLE Input in use" | Ensure no other application is using **CABLE Input**. |

### 2.5. Multichannel output mismatch
EffeTune outputs channels in order 1→2→…→8. If Windows is configured for 4 channels, the rear channels may map to center/sub. **Workaround:** set the device to 7.1ch, output 8ch from EffeTune, and use channels 5 and 6 for rear audio.

## 3. Multichannel & Hardware Connections

### 3.1. HDMI + AV receiver
Set your PC's HDMI output to 7.1ch and connect it to an AV receiver. EffeTune can send up to 8 channels through a single cable. Older receivers may degrade sound quality or remap channels unexpectedly.

### 3.2. Interfaces without multichannel drivers (e.g., MOTU M4)
Out 1‑2 and Out 3‑4 appear as separate devices, preventing 4‑channel output. Workarounds:
- Use **Voicemeeter** to merge channels via ASIO.
- Use **ASIO Link Pro** to expose one virtual 4‑channel device (advanced).

### 3.3. Channel delay & time alignment
Use **MultiChannel Panel** or **Time Alignment** to delay channels in 10 µs steps (minimum 1 sample). For large delays, delay front channels by 100‑400 ms. Video sync must be adjusted on the player side.

### 3.4. 8ch limit and expansion
Current OS drivers support up to 8 channels. EffeTune can support more channels when operating systems allow it.

## 4. Frequently Asked Questions

| Question | Answer |
| ------ | ------ |
| Surround input (5.1ch etc.)? | The Web Audio API limits input to 2 channels. Output and effects support up to 8 channels. |
| Recommended effect chain length? | Use as many effects as your CPU allows without causing dropouts or high latency. |
| How to get the best sound quality? | Use 96 kHz or higher, start with subtle settings, monitor headroom with **Level Meter**, and add **Brickwall Limiter** if needed. |
| Does it work with any source? | Yes. With a virtual audio device you can process streaming, local files, or physical equipment. |
| AV receiver vs. interface cost? | Reusing an AV receiver with HDMI is simple. For PC-centric setups, a multichannel interface plus small amps offers good cost and quality. |
| No sound from other apps right after installing VB-CABLE | The OS default output was switched to **CABLE Input**. Change it back in sound settings. |
| Only channels 3+4 change volume after splitting | Place a **Volume** effect after the splitter and set **Channel** to 3+4. If placed before, all channels change. |

## 5. Frequency Response & Room Correction

### 5.1. Importing AutoEQ settings into 15Band PEQ
From EffeTune v1.51 or later, you can import AutoEQ equalizer settings directly from the button in the top right.

### 5.2. Pasting measurement correction settings
Copy the 5Band PEQ settings from the measurement page and paste into the **Effect Pipeline** view using **Ctrl+V** or the menu.

## 6. Effect Operation Tips
* Signal flow is top to bottom.
* Use the **Matrix** effect for conversions like 2→4ch or 8→2ch (set **Channel = All** in bus routing).
* Manage level, mute, and delay for up to 8 channels with **MultiChannel Panel**.
