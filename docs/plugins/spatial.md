# Spatial Audio Plugins

A collection of plugins that enhance how your music sounds in your headphones or speakers by adjusting the stereo (left and right) balance. These effects can make your music sound more spacious and natural, especially when listening with headphones.

## Plugin List

- [MS Matrix](#ms-matrix) - Adjust stereo image by separately controlling Mid and Side levels, with optional Left/Right swap  
- [Multiband Balance](#multiband-balance) - 5-band frequency-dependent stereo balance control  
- [Stereo Blend](#stereo-blend) - Controls stereo width from mono to enhanced stereo

## MS Matrix

A flexible mid/side processor that lets you control the center (mid) and width (side) of your stereo signal independently. Use simple gain controls and an optional Left/Right swap to fine-tune how your audio sits in the stereo field without complex routing.

### Key Features
- Separate Mid and Side gain (–18 dB to +18 dB)  
- Mode switch: Encode (Stereo→M/S) or Decode (M/S→Stereo)  
- Optional Left/Right swap before encoding or after decoding  
- Click-free parameter changes for smooth adjustments  

### Parameters
- **Mode** (Encode/Decode)  
- **Mid Gain** (–18 dB to +18 dB): Adjusts level of center content  
- **Side Gain** (–18 dB to +18 dB): Adjusts level of stereo difference (width)  
- **Swap L/R** (Off/On): Swaps left and right channels before encoding or after decoding  

### Recommended Settings
1. **Subtle Widening**  
   - Mode: Decode  
   - Mid Gain: 0 dB  
   - Side Gain: +3 dB  
   - Swap: Off  
2. **Center Focus**  
   - Mode: Decode  
   - Mid Gain: +3 dB  
   - Side Gain: –3 dB  
   - Swap: Off  
3. **Creative Flip**  
   - Mode: Encode  
   - Mid Gain: 0 dB  
   - Side Gain: 0 dB  
   - Swap: On  

### Quick Start Guide
1. Select **Mode** for conversion  
2. Adjust **Mid Gain** and **Side Gain**  
3. Enable **Swap L/R** for channel correction or creative inversion  
4. Bypass to compare and verify no phase issues  

## Multiband Balance

A sophisticated spatial processor that divides the audio into five frequency bands and allows independent stereo balance control of each band. This plugin enables precise control over the stereo image across the frequency spectrum, offering creative possibilities for sound design and mixing, as well as corrective applications for problematic stereo recordings.

### Key Features
- 5-band frequency-dependent stereo balance control
- High-quality Linkwitz-Riley crossover filters
- Linear balance control for precise stereo adjustment
- Independent processing of left and right channels
- Click-free parameter changes with automatic fade handling

### Parameters

#### Crossover Frequencies
- **Freq 1** (20-500 Hz): Separates low and low-mid bands
- **Freq 2** (100-2000 Hz): Separates low-mid and mid bands
- **Freq 3** (500-8000 Hz): Separates mid and high-mid bands
- **Freq 4** (1000-20000 Hz): Separates high-mid and high bands

#### Band Controls
Each band has independent balance control:
- **Band 1 Bal.** (-100% to +100%): Controls stereo balance of low frequencies
- **Band 2 Bal.** (-100% to +100%): Controls stereo balance of low-mid frequencies
- **Band 3 Bal.** (-100% to +100%): Controls stereo balance of mid frequencies
- **Band 4 Bal.** (-100% to +100%): Controls stereo balance of high-mid frequencies

### Application Guide

1. Mix Enhancement
   - Keep low frequencies (below 100 Hz) centered for stable bass
   - Gradually increase stereo width with frequency
   - Use moderate settings (±30-50%) for natural enhancement
   - Monitor in mono to check for phase issues

2. Problem Solving
   - Correct phase issues in specific frequency ranges
   - Tighten unfocused bass by centering low frequencies
   - Reduce harsh stereo artifacts in high frequencies
   - Fix poorly recorded stereo tracks

3. Creative Sound Design

   - Correct uneven stereo distribution
   - Enhance stereo separation where needed
   - Maintain mono compatibility

### Quick Start Guide

1. Initial Setup
   - Start with all bands centered (0%)
   - Set crossover frequencies to standard points:
     * Freq 1: 100 Hz
     * Freq 2: 500 Hz
     * Freq 3: 2000 Hz
     * Freq 4: 8000 Hz

## Stereo Blend

An effect that helps achieve a more natural sound field by adjusting the stereo width of your music. It's particularly useful for headphone listening, where it can reduce the exaggerated stereo separation that often occurs with headphones, making the listening experience more natural and less fatiguing. It can also enhance the stereo image for speaker listening when needed.

### Listening Enhancement Guide
- Headphone Optimization:
  - Reduce stereo width (60-90%) for more natural, speaker-like presentation
  - Minimize listening fatigue from excessive stereo separation
  - Create a more realistic front-focused soundstage
- Speaker Enhancement:
  - Maintain original stereo image (100%) for accurate reproduction
  - Subtle enhancement (110-130%) for wider soundstage when needed
  - Careful adjustment to maintain natural sound field
- Sound Field Control:
  - Focus on natural, realistic presentation
  - Avoid excessive width that could sound artificial
  - Optimize for your specific listening environment

### Parameters
- **Stereo** - Controls the stereo width (0-200%)
  - 0%: Full mono (left and right channels summed)
  - 100%: Original stereo image
  - 200%: Enhanced stereo with maximum width (L-R/R-L)

### Recommended Settings for Different Listening Scenarios

1. Headphone Listening (Natural)
   - Stereo: 60-90%
   - Effect: Reduced stereo separation
   - Perfect for: Long listening sessions, reducing fatigue
