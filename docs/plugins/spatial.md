# Spatial Audio Plugins

A collection of plugins that enhance how your music sounds in your headphones or speakers by adjusting the stereo (left and right) balance. These effects can make your music sound more spacious and natural, especially when listening with headphones.

## Plugin List

- [Crossfeed Filter](#crossfeed-filter) - Headphone crossfeed filter for natural stereo imaging
- [MS Matrix](#ms-matrix) - Adjust stereo image by separately controlling Mid and Side levels, with optional Left/Right swap  
- [Multiband Balance](#multiband-balance) - 5-band frequency-dependent stereo balance control  
- [Stereo Blend](#stereo-blend) - Controls stereo width from mono to enhanced stereo

## Crossfeed Filter

A headphone crossfeed filter that simulates the natural acoustic crosstalk that occurs when listening through speakers. This effect helps reduce the exaggerated stereo separation often experienced with headphones, creating a more natural and comfortable listening experience that mimics the way sound reaches our ears in a real acoustic environment.

### Key Features
- Simulates natural acoustic crosstalk for headphone listening
- Adjustable crossfeed level and timing
- Low-pass filtering to mimic frequency-dependent crosstalk
- Stereo-only processing (automatically bypassed for mono signals)

### Parameters
- **Level** (-60 dB to 0 dB): Controls the amount of crossfeed signal
  - Lower values (-20 dB to -6 dB): Subtle, natural crossfeed
  - Higher values (-6 dB to 0 dB): More pronounced effect
- **Delay** (0 ms to 1 ms): Simulates the time difference of acoustic crosstalk
  - Lower values (0.1-0.3 ms): Tighter, more focused image
  - Higher values (0.3-1.0 ms): More spacious, speaker-like presentation
- **LPF Freq** (100 Hz to 20000 Hz): Controls the frequency response of crossfeed
  - Lower values (500-1000 Hz): More natural, frequency-dependent crosstalk
  - Higher values (1000-20000 Hz): Broader frequency response

### Recommended Settings
