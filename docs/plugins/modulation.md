# Modulation Plugins

A collection of plugins that add movement and variation to your music through modulation effects. These effects can make your digital music feel more organic and dynamic, enhancing your listening experience with subtle or dramatic variations in sound.

## Plugin List

- [Doppler Distortion](#doppler-distortion) - Simulates the natural, dynamic shifts in sound from subtle speaker cone movement.
- [Pitch Shifter](#pitch-shifter) - Changes the pitch of your music without affecting playback speed
- [HQ Pitch Shifter](#hq-pitch-shifter) - Higher-quality pitch shifting using a phase vocoder
- [Tremolo](#tremolo) - Creates rhythmic volume variations for a pulsing, dynamic sound
- [Wow Flutter](#wow-flutter) - Recreates the gentle pitch variations of vinyl records and tape players

## Doppler Distortion

Experience a unique audio effect that brings a touch of natural movement to your music. Doppler Distortion simulates the gentle distortions created by the physical movement of a speaker cone. This effect introduces slight changes in the sound's depth and tone, much like the familiar pitch shifts you hear when a sound source moves relative to you. It adds a dynamic, immersive quality to your listening experience by making the audio feel more alive and engaging.

### Parameters

- **Coil Force (N)**  
  Controls the strength of the simulated speaker coil movement. Higher values result in a more pronounced distortion.

- **Speaker Mass (kg)**  
  Simulates the weight of the speaker cone, affecting how naturally the movement is reproduced.  
  - **Higher values:** Increase the inertia, resulting in a slower response and smoother, subtler distortions.  
  - **Lower values:** Reduce the inertia, causing a quicker, more pronounced modulation effect.

- **Spring Constant (N/m)**  
  Determines the stiffness of the speaker's suspension. A higher spring constant produces a crisper, more defined response.

- **Damping Factor (N·s/m)**  
  Adjusts how quickly the simulated movement settles, balancing lively motion with smooth transitions.  
  - **Higher values:** Lead to faster stabilization, reducing oscillations and producing a tighter, more controlled effect.  
  - **Lower values:** Allow the movement to persist longer, resulting in a looser, more extended dynamic fluctuation.

### Recommended Settings

For a balanced and natural enhancement, start with:
- **Coil Force:** 8.0 N  
- **Speaker Mass:** 0.03 kg  
- **Spring Constant:** 6000 N/m  
- **Damping Factor:** 1.5 N·s/m  

These settings provide a subtle Doppler Distortion that enriches the listening experience without overpowering the original sound.

## Pitch Shifter

An effect that changes the pitch of your music without affecting its playback speed. This allows you to experience your favorite songs in different keys, making them sound higher or lower while maintaining the original tempo and rhythm.

### Parameters
- **Pitch Shift** - Changes the overall pitch in semitones (-6 to +6)
  - Negative values: Lowers the pitch (deeper, lower sound)
  - Zero: No change (original pitch)
  - Positive values: Raises the pitch (higher, brighter sound)
- **Fine Tune** - Makes subtle pitch adjustments in cents (-50 to +50)
  - Allows for precise tuning between semitones
  - Perfect for minor adjustments when a full semitone is too much
- **Window Size** - Controls the analysis window size in milliseconds (80 to 500ms)
  - Smaller values (80-150ms): Better for transient-rich material like percussion
  - Medium values (150-300ms): Good balance for most music
  - Larger values (300-500ms): Better for smooth, sustained sounds
- **XFade Time** - Sets the crossfade time between processed segments in milliseconds (20 to 40ms)
  - Affects how smoothly the pitch-shifted segments blend together
  - Lower values may sound more immediate but potentially less smooth
  - Higher values create smoother transitions between segments, but may increase sound wavering and create an overlapping sensation

## HQ Pitch Shifter

A higher-quality pitch shifter that uses a phase vocoder algorithm for smoother results. It preserves timing while allowing for wider pitch ranges.

### Parameters
- **Pitch Shift** - Adjusts the pitch in semitones (-12 to +12)
- **Fine Tune** - Fine adjustment in cents (-50 to +50)
- **Window Size** - Analysis window in milliseconds (20 to 100ms)
- **Oversample** - Processing oversampling factor (2 to 16)
