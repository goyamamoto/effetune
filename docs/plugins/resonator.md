# Resonator Plugins

A collection of plugins that emphasize resonant characteristics to add unique tonal textures and color to your music. These effects simulate resonances found in physical objects or speaker systems, enhancing your listening experience with warmth, shimmer, or vintage character.

## Plugin List

- [Horn Resonator](#horn-resonator) - Simulates the resonance of horn speaker systems
- [Horn Resonator Plus](#horn-resonator-plus) - Enhanced horn model with advanced reflections
- [Modal Resonator](#modal-resonator) - Frequency resonance effect with up to 5 resonators

## Horn Resonator

A plugin that simulates the resonance of a horn-loaded speaker using a digital waveguide model. It adds a warm, natural horn speaker character by modeling wave reflections at the throat and mouth, allowing you to shape the sound with simple controls.

### Listening Guide

- Warm midrange boost: accents vocals and acoustic instruments without harshness.
- Natural horn ambience: adds vintage speaker coloration for richer listening.
- Smooth high-frequency damping: prevents sharp peaks for a relaxed tone.

### Parameters

- **Crossover (Hz)** - Sets the frequency split between the low-frequency path (delayed) and the high-frequency path processed by the horn model. (20–5000 Hz)
- **Horn Length (cm)** - Adjusts the length of the simulated horn. Longer horns emphasize lower frequencies and increase resonance spacing, shorter horns emphasize higher frequencies and tighten the sound. (20–120 cm)
- **Throat Diameter (cm)** - Controls the opening size at the horn's throat (input). Smaller values tend to increase brightness and upper midrange emphasis, larger values add warmth. (0.5–50 cm)
- **Mouth Diameter (cm)** - Controls the opening size at the horn's mouth (output). This affects the impedance matching to the surrounding air and influences the frequency-dependent reflection at the mouth. Larger values generally widen the perceived sound and reduce low-frequency reflection, smaller values focus it and increase low-frequency reflection. (5–200 cm)
- **Curve (%)** - Tunes the horn's flare shape (how the radius increases from throat to mouth).
    - `0 %`: Creates a conical horn (radius increases linearly with distance).
    - Positive values (`> 0 %`): Creates flares that expand more rapidly towards the mouth (e.g., exponential). Higher values mean slower expansion near the throat and very rapid expansion near the mouth.
    - Negative values (`< 0 %`): Creates flares that expand very rapidly near the throat and then more slowly towards the mouth (e.g., parabolic or tractrix-like). More negative values mean more rapid initial expansion.
    (-100–100 %)
- **Damping (dB/m)** - Sets internal attenuation (sound absorption) per meter within the horn waveguide. Higher values reduce resonance peaks and create a smoother, more damped sound. (0–10 dB/m)
- **Throat Reflection** - Adjusts the reflection coefficient at the horn's throat (input). Higher values increase the amount of sound reflected back into the horn from the throat boundary, which can brighten the response and emphasize certain resonances. (0–0.99)
- **Output Gain (dB)** - Controls the overall output level of the processed (high-frequency) signal path before mixing with the delayed low-frequency path. Use it to match or boost the effect level. (-36–36 dB)

### Quick Start

1.  Set **Crossover** to define the frequency range sent into the horn model (e.g., 800–2000 Hz). Frequencies below this are delayed and mixed back in.
2.  Start with a **Horn Length** of around 60-70 cm for a typical midrange character.
3.  Adjust **Throat Diameter** and **Mouth Diameter** to shape the core tone (brightness vs. warmth, focus vs. width).
4.  Use **Curve** to fine-tune the resonant character (try 0% for conical, positive for exponential-like, negative for tractrix-like flare).
5.  Tweak **Damping** and **Throat Reflection** for smoothness or emphasis of the horn's resonances.
6.  Use **Output Gain** to balance the level of the horn sound against the bypassed low frequencies.

## Horn Resonator Plus

An enhanced horn model that uses a 2nd-order mouth reflection filter and a frequency-dependent throat reflection for smoother resonance.

Horn Resonator Plus is an advanced implementation based on the [Horn Resonator](#horn-resonator), featuring a more rigorous horn transmission line model with the following technical improvements:

### Technical Enhancements

- **2nd-order mouth reflection filter**: More accurate modeling of frequency-dependent reflection at the mouth opening for smoother resonance characteristics
- **Frequency-dependent throat reflection**: Throat reflection characteristics that adapt to frequency for more natural acoustic behavior
- **Updated Bessel Y1 coefficients**: Radiation impedance uses higher-precision constants for more accurate resonance modeling

### Acoustic Characteristics

Horn Resonator Plus provides superior sound quality compared to the standard Horn Resonator in the following aspects:

- **Smoother frequency response**: The 2nd-order mouth reflection filter creates more natural resonance peak decay
- **More realistic high-frequency behavior**: Group delay characteristics in the high-frequency range more closely resemble real acoustic instruments

### Parameters and Usage

Horn Resonator Plus uses the same parameters as [Horn Resonator](#horn-resonator). Please refer to the Horn Resonator section for parameter descriptions, settings, and recommended values.

### Usage Guidelines

- **Horn Resonator**: Choose when you need lightweight processing with basic horn characteristics
- **Horn Resonator Plus**: Choose when you require higher quality and more natural horn acoustic characteristics (approximately +10% CPU cost)

### Quick Start Guide

Use the same controls as the [Horn Resonator](#horn-resonator). Choose Horn Resonator Plus when you want higher quality results.

## Modal Resonator

A creative effect that adds resonant frequencies to your audio. This plugin creates tuned resonances at specific frequencies, similar to how physical objects vibrate at their natural resonant frequencies. It's perfect for adding unique tonal characteristics, simulating the resonant properties of different materials, or creating special effects.

### Listening Experience Guide

- **Metallic Resonance:**
  - Creates bell-like or metallic tones that follow the dynamics of the source material.
  - Useful for adding shimmer or a metallic character to percussion, synths, or full mixes.
  - Use multiple resonators at carefully tuned frequencies with moderate decay times.
- **Tonal Enhancement:**
  - Subtly reinforces specific frequencies in the music.
  - Can accentuate harmonics or add fullness to specific frequency ranges.
  - Use with low mix values (10-20%) for subtle enhancement.
