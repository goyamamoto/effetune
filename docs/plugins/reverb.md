# Reverb Plugins

A collection of plugins that add space and atmosphere to your music. These effects can make your music sound like it's being played in different environments, from intimate rooms to grand concert halls, enhancing your listening experience with natural ambience and depth.

## Plugin List

- [FDN Reverb](#fdn-reverb) - Feedback Delay Network reverb with advanced diffusion matrix
- [RS Reverb](#rs-reverb) - Creates natural room ambience and space

## FDN Reverb

A sophisticated reverb effect based on Feedback Delay Network (FDN) architecture using a Hadamard diffusion matrix. This creates rich, complex reverberation with excellent density and natural decay characteristics, perfect for enhancing your music listening experience with immersive spatial effects.

### Parameters
- **Reverb Time** - How long the reverb effect lasts (0.20 to 10.00 s)
  - Short (0.2-1.0s): Quick, controlled decay for clarity
  - Medium (1.0-3.0s): Natural room-like reverberation
  - Long (3.0-10.0s): Expansive, atmospheric tails
- **Density** - Number of echo paths for complexity (4 to 8 lines)
  - 4 lines: Simpler, more defined individual echoes
  - 6 lines: Good balance of complexity and clarity
  - 8 lines: Maximum smoothness and density

  - 0.0ms: All lines have same base timing (more regular patterns)
  - Higher values: More natural, irregular reflection patterns
  - Adds realistic variation found in real acoustic spaces
- **HF Damp** - How high frequencies fade over time (0.0 to 12.0 dB/s)
  - 0.0: No damping, bright sound throughout decay
  - 3.0-6.0: Natural air absorption simulation

  - 10-30%: Subtle spatial enhancement
  - 30-60%: Noticeable reverb presence
  - 60-100%: Dominant reverb effect
- **Dry Mix** - Amount of original signal preserved (0 to 100%)
  - Usually kept at 100% for normal listening
  - Can be reduced for special atmospheric effects
- **Stereo Width** - How wide the reverb spreads in stereo (0 to 200%)
  - Implementation: 0% = mono, 100% = normal stereo, 200% = exaggerated width
  - 0%: Reverb appears in center (mono)
  - 100%: Natural stereo spread
  - 200%: Extra-wide stereo image
