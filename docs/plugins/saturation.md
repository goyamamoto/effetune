  - Adds subtle depth and dimensionality to the sound
- **Moderate Effect:**
  - Creates a more dynamic, responsive distortion
  - Adds unique movement and liveliness to sustained sounds
  - Emphasizes transients with natural-feeling compression
- **Creative Effect:**
  - Produces complex distortion patterns that evolve with the input
  - Creates resonant, speaker-like behaviors
  - Enables dramatic sound design possibilities

  - Suitable for genres needing a balanced yet enriched sound
- **Aggressive Effect:**
  - Intensifies multiple harmonics to create a rich, complex distortion
  - Provides creative sound design possibilities for experimental tracks
  - Perfect for adding edgy and unconventional textures
- **Positive vs. Negative Values:**
  - Positive values: Create compression-like effects, controlling peaks and adding warmth with greater density
  - Negative values: Generate expansion-like effects, emphasizing dynamics and creating more open, breathing sounds

### Parameters
- **2nd Harm (%):** Controls the amount of second harmonic added (-30 to 30%, default: 2%)
- **3rd Harm (%):** Adjusts the third harmonic contribution (-30 to 30%, default: 3%)
- **4th Harm (%):** Modifies the fourth harmonic intensity (-30 to 30%, default: 0.5%)
